# week4

## Learning Objective

Learn jest and unit test

## Goal

Be able to use mock and spyon to do unit test.

## Instruction

A simialr setting of last week, we will try to implement a test for a sample async function.
This time, you are given a complete function but an empty test. This test needs to mock the async function result so that we do not have to connect to interenet/database to run the actual test.

Read the api doc on the interenet of jest to learn how to use mock or spyon. Choose one to accomplish your task. (I like spyon, some times mocking complex module is very very very hard)

Be preapre to be asked questions on your code.
