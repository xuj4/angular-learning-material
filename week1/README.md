## Learning objective: Linux

## Goal: learn basic linux operations

cd, ls, pwd, cp, mv, rm, touch, less, cat, vi, nano, diff, chown, ps, grep, pipe

## Turn in: Please submit the linux commands you use to accomplish each step in the scenario below

- Your tech lead ask you to create a folder called `menu`.
- Under this folder, you need to create two empty text files `breakfast.txt`, and `lunch.txt`.
- You need print a list of files in this directory `order by last datestamp`.
- Now use `echo` to write `bacon egg sandwich` into breakfast.txt.
- After that use `diff` to compare breakfast.txt and lunch.txt see if breakfast.txt has the value you echo in last step.
- Now use `cat` or `less` to print the breakfast content. Do your own research to find out the difference between cat and less.
- Use `chown` to change the ownership of the breakfast file to root user. Change permission to 775.
- Edit lunch.txt using `nano` or `vi` or `emacs`, put in text conent 'cheese burger'
- Print current directory path
- Copy lunch.txt and create a file called dinner.txt
- remove dinner.txt
- go to directory above and `delete` folder menu together with all files

- Now try to run this command `sleep 600 &`
- Use `ps aux` and `grep` to find the pid of the sleep process (use pipe `|`)
- Kill the process (You will use this a lot while running node app locally)

## Discuss with your peers or friends if you need help. All of the answers can be information on interenet.
