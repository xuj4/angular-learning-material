# week12

## Learning Objective

angular deployment (ng build)

1. Create a firebase free tier hosting account with Spark Plan (use your existing godaddy, aws or any other hosting solution if you already have one)
2. Watch the angular videos of this week
3. Deploy your little app from week #7 or any angular app you have played with. Our project code will not work since it requires authentication
4. Having a free web host is especially helpful as a sandbox environment where you can play with code and new tools. Watch carefully on the monthly bill. I have had AWS change me few hundred dollars because I forgot my k8s cluster auto restart two large EC2 instances.
