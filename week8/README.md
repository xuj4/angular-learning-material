# week8

## Learning Objective

We have to learn some basics on the CSS libraries you are going to use with the SE development team.

1. bootstrap css
2. angular material design

There is no specific exercise for this week. Please go through the angular material api doc to get familar with the components offered. We will not build our textbox, button etc. All of the UI elemenet will come from material design.

bootstrap is another useful tool where you can easily manage the grid and make your website mobile friendly without writting media css. Make sure you read this and use bootstrap grid system in your code.
