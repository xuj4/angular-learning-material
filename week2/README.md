# What is Jest

JEST is my go to testing framework for 2021. It's fast, typescript oriented, easy to use, easy to learn and can be used to both frontend and backend. We will have a couple of jest practice in next two weeks.

# What is dBeaver

Dbeaver is an awesome db management tool that offers support on various types of databases. I have been using it for both OU project with oracle, personal project with postgres, redshift and mysql. The tool is becoming really popular in the industry. Edu email get EE version which offers pretty much everything you would need including restore, backup, migration, pl-sql operations etc. I will require you to install this tool for our cohort, we will probably try another one next semester maybe DataGrip.

# What is prettier

Another good friend I made 2021. Suprisingly good on standardize your code. With over 15 million weekly download, It definately worth your attention to give it a shot. I ask you to install the prettier extension on your VSCode IDE and turn on auto format on save, pay attention to what get changed and write your code so it does not need auto format one day. I am sure your interviewer will be impressed by your coding syntax following prettier rule at your live coding session.

# What is eslint

This does not need your specific attention for this week. Basicly it's a tool to help you find problems before the problem blows up in production. It does functionality check and code style check.

## ----- Students feel free to ignore notes below ----

# Prettier vs Eslint

`ESLint` tell you what is wrong and can help you fix with some issues

`Prettier` does format for you, no more discussions on linter rules

`Prettier` + `ESLint` = ❤️

Why `Prettier` ?

- They keep everybody on the same page, same rules.
- They save time in code reviews
- Popularity

Why `Prettier` is stict and opinionated.
Because this way your team will focus more on producing functional code rather than arguing on the "best practices" such as formatting conditional branches.
